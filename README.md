# Assignment-2

This repository contains two Python programs for basic control flow and looping:

### Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Uses an `if-else` statement to determine if the number is even or odd.
- Displays the result accordingly.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Calculates the sum of all integers in that range.
- Displays the total sum.
